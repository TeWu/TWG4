  # Roles are defined like 'role_name: position_in_roles_bitmask'.
  # NOTE: Roles should be positioned from the least to the most privileged (because of how permissions are defined in Ability class).
  # NOTE: roles bitmask is usually 32 bits (4 bytes) long +- sign bit.
  # ! WARNING ! Be careful when changing position in roles bitmask for existing role - it can change whether or not this role is assigned to existing users.
